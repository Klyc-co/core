# KLYC Backend — AI Orchestration Architecture

## Overview

KLYC is a backend AI orchestration service powered by the Claude API. The React UI serves as a **development interface** only. The production UI exists in **Loveable** and calls the KLYC backend through REST APIs.

### Singular Agent Architecture (v3)

The backend drives a **single unified agent** (`KLYCAgent`) with 9 submind personality profiles. Each submind is a different lens the same intelligence looks through — not 9 separate agents, but one mind shifting focus.

All AI calls go to the **Claude API** via raw fetch (zero-dependency edge deployment).

## Submind Profiles

| Submind | Model | Temp | Focus |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| normalizer | none | 0 | Structural analysis, classification, coverage |
| research | Sonnet | 0.7 | Market signals, audience, competitive gaps |
| product | Sonnet | 0.6 | Positioning, differentiators, trust signals |
| narrative | Sonnet | 0.8 | 3-5 candidates across 7 narrative types |
| social | Sonnet | 0.7 | Platform-native posts (LinkedIn/X/Instagram) |
| image | Haiku | 0.6 | Creative prompts with orientation + fallbacks |
| editor | Sonnet | 0.4 | QA review, brand consistency, quality scoring |
| approval | Haiku | 0.3 | Risk assessment, compliance, regulatory flags |
| analytics | Sonnet | 0.5 | Viral scoring, amplify/monitor/archive |

## Repository

**Production repo**: `klyc-ai/klyc_social_marketing_atscale`

## API Endpoints

### Campaign
- `POST /api/ai/campaign` — Create campaign (full pipeline)
- `POST /api/ai/content` — Generate content
- `GET /api/ai/status` — Health check

## Environment Variables

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Set in `.env` locally and in Supabase Edge Function environment for production.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Migration History

- **v1**: OpenAI-based multi-agent (ai-controller repo)
- **v2**: Claude API multi-agent (klyc_social_marketing_atscale, March 2026)
- **v3**: Singular agent with submind profiles (current)
